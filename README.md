Teeny Python utility for converting the monster[] block that describes a 
venue's enemies into the headers used by the Master Raw Dump (Google Sheets)
to make the data somewhat sensical.

HOW TO:

1. Copy the monster block for a given venue into in.txt. I've already loaded one in as an example.

2. Double-click header_digest.py

3. Open out.csv in Excel or a similar program*

4. Copy-paste into the master dump, on the Headers page, and add the venue name as per usual


*Google Sheets won't format copy-pasted .csvs right, as far as I can tell. Discard this step if you figure out how to get it to split cells right (and let me know).

Happy data collecting!
